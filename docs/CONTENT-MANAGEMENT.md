# Content Management — Google Drive Sync
Version: v1 · Last updated: 2026-07-18

## Availability
A Google Drive connector IS available to you. Use it to read/pull
content when asked. You have NO background/passive awareness of Drive —
you don't get notified when the user adds a file, and nothing happens
automatically between sessions. You only act when the user starts a
session and asks you to check.

The user's real-world habit: they drop new photos/files into Drive,
then separately come to you and say something like "run the content
sync" or "scan drive." When asked to do this, follow the procedure below.

## Content sync from Drive — procedure
1. Go to the Rotary Website project folder in Drive. It has one
   subfolder per site section: President, Officers and Members, Service
   Projects, Partner Merchants, Digital Bulletin, Branding (Logo, Banner,
   Favicon), Contact Info.
2. Read "PHOTO FRESHNESS CONVENTION.txt" and the latest-numbered
   "TODO - Website Content Checklist" file in the folder root first.
3. Freshness rule: no filename convention exists or is needed — sort
   files within each section folder by Drive's `createdTime` (NOT
   `modifiedTime`, which often reflects the original photo's pre-upload
   date, e.g. when it was taken on a phone, not when it landed in Drive).
4. Slot counts — how many stay "active" per section (see table below).
   For sections with a limit, take the newest N by createdTime as the
   active set. Officer/Member headshots and Merchant logos are 1:1 per
   person/business, not rotating slots — no slot limit applies to those.
5. Cross-check what's actually in each folder against what the TODO
   checklist says is still outstanding.
6. Images dropped into Drive are generally ALREADY at the correct spec
   resolution (per the Media Specifications Guide in Drive) — do not
   resize/compress unless a specific file is clearly not.
7. Download and add needed assets into this repo's assets/ folder,
   organized by section (e.g. assets/merchants/, assets/projects/,
   assets/president/).
8. Do NOT wire new assets into live HTML in the same pass unless
   explicitly asked to — first pass is pull + organize + match content
   to its real-world meaning (e.g. which logo belongs to which merchant).
9. Always show a full summary of what was found/pulled/matched, and
   flag anything ambiguous or unmatched, BEFORE committing anything.
   Wait for the user's approval before commit/push.

## Slot counts per section
| Section | Live site slot count |
|---|---|
| Banner (hero) | 3 (rotating hero backgrounds) |
| About Rotary | 1 |
| Four-Way Test | 1 |
| Recent Projects | 3 (homepage carousel) |
| Projects Archive | 4 (Service Projects grid) |
| President | 1 |
| Officer/Member headshots | 1:1 per person, no shared limit |
| Merchant logos | 1:1 per business, no shared limit |

## Retirement logic (for slot-limited sections)
When a new upload would push a section past its slot count:
1. Sort that section's files by createdTime, newest first
2. Move (never delete) the oldest file(s) beyond the limit into a
   "_Retired" subfolder within that section's Drive folder
3. This is a Drive-organization step, not a repo step — it keeps Drive
   itself tidy and unambiguous about what's current, separate from
   what's actually been pulled into the repo so far

## Known real content already in Drive (as of 2026-07-18)
- Partner Merchants: "DTC Partners.xlsx" (28 partners confirmed — see
  Open Items below, an earlier note here said 26) + 27 individual logo
  files (1 partner, Mendoza Law Office, has no logo yet). Pulled into
  repo assets/merchants/ (logos + partners.json).
- President: real photo (assets/president/president.png) plus a full
  "Presidential Message.txt" (name, credentials, and welcome message —
  pulled into assets/president/presidential-message.txt) — both now live
  directly in the President folder.
- Branding subfolder "RCNH Website.Hero Carousel" (renamed from "Welcome
  Banner") contains the 3 real photos for the homepage's rotating hero
  background (confirmed by the rename, not just inferred) — pulled into
  assets/hero-carousel/.
- Branding subfolder "RCNH Website.Recent Projects" contains 3 real
  photos for the homepage "Recent Projects" carousel — pulled into
  assets/recent-projects/ as-is; no per-photo captions/titles exist or
  are needed.
- "About Rotary" homepage photo — pulled into assets/about-rotary/.
- Officers and Members, Service Projects, Contact Info folders were
  still empty as of last full scan — check again, this changes over time

## Open items (from the 2026-07-18 content sync pass)
- [ ] `Logo.SFOM Law.JPG` (in assets/merchants/_unmatched/) doesn't match
  any partner name in DTC Partners.xlsx — confirm with the user what
  this is before using it.
- [ ] Mendoza Law Office (in the spreadsheet) has no logo file — need one
  before it can display like the other partners.
- [ ] None of the pulled assets are wired into live HTML yet — that's a
  separate dev pass once the user confirms what's ready to go live.
